# Hide Widgets

This plugin allows you to hide all the ui widgets in Oldschool Runescape when in resizable mode using a configurable hotkey.

## Usage

When in game press the hotkey (default ctrl + H) to hide all the runescape UI and when you want to turn it off press it again, if it doesn't work please double check you are in resizable mode:

When you open Runelite or disable and enable the plugin the toggle will always be turned off by default to prevent people from getting confused when getting back into the game after a while, just pressing the hotkey again will hide the ui again

## Configuration Options
  - Hide Widgets Toggle - Sets what key combination to use to enable/disable hiding the widgets
    - Default: Ctrl + H

## Known issues
  - Runlite overlays are still shown
    - Workaround: Disable the plugins that are creating the overlay if you want the full clean look
